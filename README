WEYL-BRAUER MATRICES IN APL

Weyl-Brauer matrices are higher dimensional versions of Pauli spin matrices.
They can be built up using the Pauli spin matrices as blocks. The building up
can be done by making a mega-array of Pauli matrices then collapsing it down
by taking the outer/Kronecker product along one of its dimensions - perfect
for APL!
